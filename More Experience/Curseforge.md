# More Experience - Newfies Additions

Whats More Experience!? More Experience is a mod that adds more ways of obtaining XP, such as a new ore, new items, and more!

Whats Newfies Additions? Newfies Additions is a collection of mods that center around adding multiple new and (mostly) vanilla-like blocks, tools, and other cool things to your Minecraft world. Most of these are things I needed in the past to exist, that I could've added, but then was probably like "nah", then I went into creative and got the thing I needed.
