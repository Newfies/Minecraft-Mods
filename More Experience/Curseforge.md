# More Experience - Newfies Additions

Whats More Experience!? More Experience is a mod that adds more ways of obtaining XP, such as a new ore, new items, and more!

Whats Newfies Additions? Newfies Additions is a collection of mods that center around adding multiple new and (mostly) vanilla-like blocks, tools, and other cool things to your Minecraft world.
