# Newfies Additions (Set A)

Whats Newfies Additions!? Newfies Additions is a mod that adds multiple new and (mostly) vanilla-like blocks, tools, and other cool things to your Minecraft world. Most of these are things I needed in the past to exist, that I could've added, but then was probably like "nah", then I went into creative and got the thing I needed.

### Some of the features of this mod are as followed:

#### Experience Related Items

**I thought having custom ores for Experience would be cool. So we have Experience Ore and Deepslate Experience Ore, which drop a random amount of Experience Dust, which can be used to make a Experience Bottle. You also get more with fortune on both. Experience Ore spawns on a Y minimum of 0 and maximum of 256 in the place of any stone, while Deepslate Experience Ore spawns on a Y minimum of -64 and maximum of 25 in the place of any stone.**


- Experience Dust

**Experience Dust is obtained by mining either the Experience Ore or the Deepslate Experience Ore.**

- Experience Ore

**Ore that drops Experience Dust. This block can only be mined with a stone pickage or anything stronger. This block has custom sounds.**

- Deepslate Experience Ore

**Ore that drops Experience Dust. This block can only be mined with a stone pickage or anything stronger. This block has custom sounds.**

- Experience Bottle Recipe

**Made by surrounding a empty bottle with Experience Dust**
