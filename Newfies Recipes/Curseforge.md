# Newfies Recipes

Whats Newfies Recipes!? Newfies Recipes is a mod that adds multiple new and (mostly) vanilla-like recipes to your Minecraft world. Most of these recipes are things I needed in the past to exist, that I could've added, but then was probably like "nah", then I went into creative and got the thing I needed.

### Some of the features of this mod are as followed:

- A recipe to turn wool into string using a stonecutter, a furnace, or a blast furnace.

**This is good if you need string, but cannot be bothered to find and or kill Spiders, and you have a bunch of wool laying around. The only downside of this being that you get 1x string for 1x wool.**

- A recipe to get a cobweb by using 5x string.

**This is good if you specificly (and randomly) need cobweb (after killing Sheep instead of finding Spiders) for maybe your MLG clutch moment, recipes from other mods (which is what I needed it for), etc.**

- A recipe to make lead by using 3x string.

**I added this because the Waystone mod needs you to lasso mobs you wanna bring with you. Ofcourse I only added it after I figured out a way to do it by walking for 3000 blocks.**

### Why are all these string related? Honestly, I don't know, I plan to impliment more quite soon (whenever I'm not lazy)

To see more detailed information I recommend you visit the GitHub where you can find the README and the deobfuscated version of the mod!
