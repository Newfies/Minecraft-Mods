## Newfies Recipes

Whats Newfies Recipes!? Newfies Recipes is a mod that adds multiple new and (mostly) vanilla-like recipes to your Minecraft world. Most of these recipes are things I needed in the past to exist, that I could've added, but then was probably like "nah", then I went into creative and got the thing I needed.

### Some of the features of this mod are as followed:
**If You need string, but cannot be bothered to find and or kill Spiders, and you have a bunch of wool laying around. The only downside of this being that you get 1x string for 1x wool.**
**If you specificly (and randomly) need cobweb (after killing Sheep instead of finding Spiders) for maybe your MLG clutch moment, recipes from other mods (which is what I needed it for), etc.**
**If using the Waystone mod, it needs you to lasso mobs you wanna bring with you.**

### Methods

- Crafting is the Crafting Table.
- Smelting is Furnace recipe.
